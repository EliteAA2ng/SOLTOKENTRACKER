## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- A Helius API key (recommended) - get one at [helius.xyz](https://helius.xyz)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd solana-token-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Usage

1. **Enter Token Mint Address**: Paste any Solana SPL token mint address
2. **Optional Wallet Filter**: Enter a specific wallet address to filter transfers
3. **Add Helius API Key**: Your key for enhanced performance and reliability
4. **Select Time Period**: Choose lookback window (5 seconds to 24 hours)
5. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Transfers" to fetch and display results

The app will automatically:
- Fetch comprehensive token information (name, price, market data)
- Display token logo, social links, and project details
- Show real-time transfer data with streaming updates
- Provide direct links to blockchain explorers

## Configuration

### Default Settings

- **Lookback Period**: 10 minutes (optimized for performance)
- **Max Signatures**: 1000 per query
- **Max Transactions**: 100 processed per analysis
- **Request Delay**: 100ms between API calls

### Helius API Key

For best performance and reliability:

1. Visit [helius.xyz](https://helius.xyz)
2. Sign up and create a free API key
3. Enter it in the app interface

### Environment Variables (Optional)

```bash
# Optional: Set as environment variable
echo "VITE_HELIUS_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env.local
```

## Data Sources

The app fetches comprehensive token information from multiple reliable sources:

### Blockchain Data

- **Helius RPC**: Enhanced Solana RPC with better rate limits and additional endpoints
- **Standard Solana RPC**: Fallback for transaction and account data
- **Block Explorer APIs**: Additional transaction parsing capabilities

### Token Data Sources

- **Jupiter Token List**: Comprehensive token registry with names, symbols, and logos
- **CoinGecko API**: Market data, price information, and social media links  
- **DexScreener API**: Real-time price data, market cap, and trading volumes
- **Birdeye API** (Optional Premium): Enhanced market data, liquidity metrics, and token analytics (paid subscription required)

All data is fetched in parallel for optimal performance, with graceful fallbacks if any source is unavailable.

## How It Works

The tracker uses advanced detection logic to find all token transfers:

1. **Token Metadata Fetching**: Gets token name, symbol, and decimals from Jupiter API
2. **Multi-Source Analysis**: 
   - For wallet-specific queries: Analyzes both signed transactions and token account activity
   - For token-wide queries: Uses Helius Enhanced APIs or samples largest token accounts
3. **Balance Delta Calculation**: Compares pre/post token balances to determine transfer amounts
4. **Smart Counterparty Resolution**: Identifies the other party in each transfer
5. **Deduplication & Sorting**: Removes duplicates and sorts by timestamp

## Performance Optimizations

- **Shorter Time Windows**: Default 10-minute lookback for faster results
- **Intelligent Sampling**: For token-wide queries, samples most active accounts
- **Enhanced APIs**: Leverages Helius Enhanced APIs when available
- **Efficient Caching**: React Query caching with 2-minute stale time
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent API calls where possible

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Solana**: @solana/web3.js + @solana/spl-token
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run preview   # Preview production build
```

## Common Token Examples

The app includes quick-select buttons for popular tokens:

- **USDC**: `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`
- **BONK**: `DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263`
- **USDT**: `Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB`
- **SOL**: `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`

## Troubleshooting

### API Issues

#### Birdeye API Failed
If you see "Birdeye API failed" in the API Status Check, this is usually due to one of these reasons:

**Common Causes:**
1. **API Key Required**: Birdeye API requires a **paid** API key - there is no free tier
2. **Demo Key Limitations**: The "demo" key has severe restrictions and often fails
3. **Invalid API Key**: Your API key may be expired or invalid
4. **CORS Issues**: Browser security may block direct API calls

**Solutions:**
1. **Get a Paid Birdeye API Key**: 
   - Visit [Birdeye API](https://docs.birdeye.so/) to purchase an API subscription
   - Set it as environment variable: `VITE_BIRDEYE_API_KEY=your-paid-key-here`

2. **Skip Birdeye (Recommended)**: 
   - The app works perfectly with just Jupiter, CoinGecko, and DexScreener
   - Birdeye is an optional enhancement, not required for core functionality

3. **Alternative Data Sources**: 
   - **Jupiter**: Token names, symbols, logos (‚úÖ Free)
   - **CoinGecko**: Market data, prices, social links (‚úÖ Free with limits)
   - **DexScreener**: Real-time prices, trading volumes (‚úÖ Free)

**Important**: Unlike other APIs, Birdeye has **NO free endpoints**. All endpoints require a paid subscription.

### Other Common Issues

If you encounter issues with token tracking:

1. **No Transfers Found**: 
   - Try increasing the lookback period
   - Check if the token address is correct
   - Some tokens may have very low trading activity

2. **Slow Performance**: 
   - Reduce the lookback period to 1-10 minutes for faster results
   - Get a Helius API key for better performance

3. **Network Errors**: 
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Some corporate networks may block blockchain APIs

## API Limits

- **Helius Free Tier**: 100,000 requests/month
- **Built-in Rate Limiting**: 100ms delays between requests
- **Transaction Limits**: Max 100 transactions processed per analysis

## Deployment

### Netlify/Vercel

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder
3. Set environment variables in your deployment platform

### Environment Variables for Production

- `VITE_HELIUS_API_KEY` - Your Helius API key (optional)
